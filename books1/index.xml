What is this book about? About a girl who grew up isolated from civilisation without going to school or seeing a doctor in her early life, that was eager to learn more about the world, and ended up a PhD from Harvard.
What did I Like Very interestingly written book. The writing style is quite unique, or at least it was different to what I was used to from other books.</description>

What is this book about? Climate change and its consequences for us and our world.
What did I Like This book is probably one of the most scariest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. The author really describe the extent of climate change and its consequences very visually, which makes it easier to grasp the vast impact climate change has.
What did I not Like Overall, the book is quite pessimistic.</description>
