      <description>I am Tabea, a graduate stats student interested in the intersection of psychology, design, and statistics.
Something personal I am a German girl currently living in the Netherlands. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved here almost five years ago to begin my undergraduate studies in psychology. Now, four/five years later, I am still enjoying life in NL and am already close to finishing my graduate studies (in statistics; not psychology anymore).
I love reading, although I get to do it way too little.</description>

      <description>On this page I am keeping track of which books I&amp;rsquo;ve read and which I plan to read. This list covers everything I&amp;rsquo;ve read since about 2018. I am updating this list from to time, and I hope it will be some inspiration for others. For those books underlined I&amp;rsquo;ve written some extra lines on what I liked or disliked. I&amp;rsquo;ve also created this general OVERVIEW to keep track of which books I liked and which I would recommend.</description>

      <description>by Tara Westerhofer
What is this book about? About a girl who grew up isolated from civilisation without going to school or seeing a doctor in her early life, that was eager to learn more about the world, and ended up a PhD from Harvard.
What did I Like Very interestingly written book. The writing style is quite unique, or at least it was different to what I was used to from other books.</description>

      <description>Skills My strength definitely lies at the intersection of the human component with the statistical component. I am good at making statistical concepts accessible to someone without experience in the field. I know how to represent data and statistical insight in such a way that everyone can understand, use and built upon them.
I am fluent in R, and have some experience in Python (which is growing every day). I am currently acquiring more knowledge and skills in handling semi-structured data (SQL, XML, JSON, RDF, etc.</description>

      <description>by David Wallace-Wells
What is this book about? Climate change and its consequences for us and our world.
What did I Like This book is probably one of the most scariest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. The author really describe the extent of climate change and its consequences very visually, which makes it easier to grasp the vast impact climate change has.
What did I not Like Overall, the book is quite pessimistic.</description>
