<p>My strength definitely lies at the intersection of the human component with the statistical component. I am good at making statistical concepts accessible to someone without experience in the field. I know how to represent data and statistical insight in such a way that everyone can understand, use and built upon them.</p>
<p>I am fluent in R, and have some experience in Python (which is growing every day). I am currently acquiring more knowledge and skills in handling semi-structured data (SQL, XML, JSON, RDF, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h2>
<p>I am currently working on my <strong>master thesis</strong>, with the topic <em>Automatic Personality Prediction Using Facial Features.</em> The idea behind this project is to combine methods of computer vision and deep learning to develop a new approach to personality prediction. Since the project is very much ongoing, I cannot share any more information just yet.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I am working at the department <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/omd/">Research Methodology, Measurement and Data Analysis at the University of Twente</a> as <strong>teaching assistant</strong>. In this role, I am giving tutorials in research methodology and statistics for various bachelor and pre-master studies within the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/">Faculty of Behavioral, Management and Social Sciences</a>. I enjoy sharing my excitement about the topic with others and therefore really appreciate being a tutor for so many students. While this is my main responsibility as teaching assistant, I also do some grading of exams and assignments, I evaluate and re-write assignments, and help the department out where I can, for example by proof-reading books to be published.</p>
<p>I am also working as a research assistant in the research group <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/cmob/">Change Management and Organisational Behaviour at the University of Twente</a>. Here, I am managing the data base that holds data of several studies conducted by the research group. Together with a colleague, I have written an R-package to ease communication with the data base and to provide easy access to the data for colleagues without any programming experience.</p>
